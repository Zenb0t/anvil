## Phase.yaml Summary

- Mode: `complicated`
- Current phase: `00-intake`
- Decisions needed: mode selection and initial constraints

## Inputs

- Primary PRD in `appendix/PRD.md`
- Known deadlines, constraints, and non-negotiables

## Operational Mode Selection

Set mode explicitly and justify it:

- `complicated`: optimize for upfront completeness, broad spec, and broad oracle.
- `complex`: optimize for safe-to-fail probes, bounded bets, and learning loops.

Record justification in this README and `phase.yaml`.

## Exit Criteria

- PRD exists and is understandable by a new agent.
- Mode selected with rationale.
- Open questions and decisions captured.
