# Phase 1: Spec

**Goal:** Write behavioral specification, define contracts, record architecture decisions, plant hardening seeds.

## Architect Role
- Write `spec.md` with behavioral requirements, state transitions, invariants
- Define contracts in `contracts/`
- Plant hardening seeds (security, performance, observability concerns to audit later)
- Interview user on edge cases, failure scenarios, security boundaries

## Outputs
- `spec.md` — Behavioral specification with invariants and hardening seeds
- `contracts/` — Interface contracts, API schemas, type definitions
