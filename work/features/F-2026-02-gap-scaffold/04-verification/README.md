## Pointers via AGENTS

- `../../../../../AGENTS.md`
- `../../../../../docs/index.md`

## Phase.yaml Summary

- Mode: `complex`
- Current phase: `04-verification`
- Focus: evidence quality and observability of behavior

## ETR Matrix (summary)

| Claim | Evidence type | Where it runs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | | |

## Refutation Requirement

For each critical claim, include at least one explicit negative/refutation attempt.

## Legibility Surface

- Required logs/metrics/traces:
- DB inspection scripts:
- Deterministic reproduction commands:

## Open Hypotheses

- Hypothesis:
- Evidence needed to resolve:

## Exit Criteria

- ETR matrix exists in `etr.md`.
- Refutation cases exist for critical claims.
- Observability and reproduction are explicit.
