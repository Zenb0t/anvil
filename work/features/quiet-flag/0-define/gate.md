# Gate: Define

- [x] Problem statement is clear and scoped
- [x] Non-goals are explicitly stated
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Constraints and risks identified
- [x] Brief reviewed with user

Status: PASS
Rationale: `brief.md` covers problem (token waste in agent harnesses), scope (3 commands, 1 flag, 1 hook), success criteria (zero stdout + correct exit codes), constraints, and risks for quiet-flag.
