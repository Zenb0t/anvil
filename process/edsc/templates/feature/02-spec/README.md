## Pointers via AGENTS

## Phase.yaml Summary

- Mode: `{{MODE}}`
- Current phase: `02-spec`
- Current blockers: `{{CURRENT_BLOCKERS}}`
- Decisions needed: `{{DECISIONS_NEEDED}}`
- Focus: behavior, invariants, and hardening seeds

## Product Spec

- Primary use cases:
- Illegal state transitions:
- Invariants:

## Hardening Seeds

- Security boundaries:
- Reliability assumptions (idempotency/retries):
- Performance budgets:
- Operational expectations:

## Exit Criteria

- Core behavior and invariants are clear.
- Illegal state transitions are documented.
- Hardening seeds are seeded for phases 4 and 6.
