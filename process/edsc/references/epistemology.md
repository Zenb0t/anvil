# Epistemology Note

Verification is not only positive confirmation.

For critical claims, require attempts to falsify assumptions. Evidence quality increases when:

- claims are explicit,
- refutation paths are defined,
- runtime observability is sufficient,
- reproduction is deterministic.

Treat each phase gate as a temporary truth state that can become stale when inputs shift.
